Hello and welcome! I'm a scientist with a curiosity for unraveling the mysteries that link the human mind and artificial intelligence. But let's not get ahead of ourselves; allow me to walk you through my journey—a tale of math, code, and a quest for understanding that goes beyond mere equations.

**The Allure of Many Fields**
Since the start of my academic journey, I have been enamored by a multitude of disciplines—ranging from the intricacies of human intelligence to the abstract beauty of mathematical models and the thought-provoking landscapes of scientific philosophy.

**Memory Models**
After diving headfirst into artificial intelligence, I found my interest in memory models. In my opinion, memory can potentially decode how intelligence—both artificial and human—functions. I believe that memory isn't just a storehouse of information; it's the foundational bedrock upon which intelligence is built. Understanding memory in its most fundamental manner unlocks the secrets of cognition and intelligent behavior.

**Current Focus: Beyond The Black Box**
Now, if you've ever delved into artificial neural networks, you've likely heard them referred to as 'black boxes,' mysterious entities that perform complex calculations yet resist easy explanation. My current research aims to shed light into them. I focus on what is called *mechanistic interpretability*, which is a fancy way of saying I want to know the "how" and the "why" behind these computational models, not just the "what."

I am trying to uncover *universal computations*—common threads in various models that may be integral to their functioning. Think of it this way: A car mechanic doesn’t merely know how to change the oil; they understand the entire engine, inside and out. That's the level of comprehension I aim for with neural networks. If we're going to trust these systems with increasingly complex tasks, we should understand their inner workings to the same degree that a mechanic understands a car engine.

**The Horizon: A Mechanic for The Mind?**
As we gaze into the future, I envision a world where artificial neural networks and human cognition are not mystical phenomena, but well-understood systems. Systems that can be diagnosed, tuned, and enhanced, much like the car at the mechanic's shop. As we draw back the curtains on the "black boxes," my hope is that this clarity propels us toward more efficient, ethical, and insightful applications that benefit us all.

As we unlock the black box of machine learning models, we not only enrich our understanding of artificial intelligence but also shed light on the mysteries of our own cognition. Feel free to connect to discuss the fascinating crossroads of AI, memory modeling, and cognitive science!)

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
