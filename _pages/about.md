I’m Arjun Karuvally, a researcher passionate about the mathematical and theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence. My work centers on understanding how neural networks store and process memory, especially focusing on recurrent architectures and energy-based models.

I enjoy exploring questions about how intelligence emerges from computation and aim to develop new frameworks that both advance our understanding and improve practical AI design. Much of my research involves bridging gaps between complex mathematical ideas and real-world AI systems.

I’m always eager to learn more, dive into challenging problems, and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve. Feel free to explore the site to obtain insight into my projects, publications, and ongoing research. If you have any comments, thoughts or queries, you can reach me at <a href="mailto:arjun.k018@gmail.com">arjun.k018@gmail.com</a>.

[comment]: <> (In the journey towards creating more intelligent, interpretable, and human-understandable AI, I believe in fostering dialogue and collaboration across disciplines. As we unlock the black box of machine learning models, we not only enrich our understanding of artificial intelligence but also shed light on the mysteries of our own cognition. Feel free to connect to discuss the fascinating crossroads of AI, memory modeling, and cognitive science!)

You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.)
