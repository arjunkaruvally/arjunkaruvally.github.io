In my class, "[Nature Inspired Design in Computing](https://arjunkaruvally.github.io/FYS-NID/)," we recently delved into the intriguing world of fractals. I put together this blog post to share some insights from exploring fractals. We'll start by unraveling the foundational definitions and intuitions, then progress to the mathematics of fractals, highlighting how our standard understanding of spatial dimensions might not quite grasp their unique nature. By the end, we'll introduce the formal concept of the box counting dimension—often referred to as the [Minkowski-Bouligand dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski%E2%80%93Bouligand_dimension)—illustrating that fractals interestingly possess fractional dimensions!

## Introduction

**What really are fractals?** Fractals are intricate patterns that repeat themselves, no matter how much you zoom in. The etymology of the term "fractal" (from Latin *fractus*) is due to this self similar nature, meaning that if you zoom in on a portion of the fractal, you will see a shape that looks similar to the larger scale. This property gives the appearance of being "broken" into smaller parts that look like the whole. Unlike simple shapes like circles or squares, fractals sit somewhere in-between dimensions, making them both fascinating and a bit mysterious. You can spot these patterns everywhere – from the way trees branch out to the designs on seashells.

### Short History

Fractals, while seemingly a modern concept, have roots that stretch back far earlier than one might think. 

**Ancient Beginnings**: While the formal study of fractals is relatively recent, many ancient cultures incorporated fractal-like patterns into their art and architecture. The recursive patterns in African art, the infinite loops in Celtic knots, and the intricate designs in Indian mandalas all hint at an innate human appreciation for self-similar patterns.

**The 19th Century and Early Pioneers**: Mathematicians like Karl Weierstrass, Georg Cantor, and Helge von Koch began exploring functions and sets which didn't have the properties of classical Euclidean geometry. Koch's famous 'snowflake curve', for instance, was a continuous curve with no tangents – a radical idea for its time.

**Benoit B. Mandelbrot – The Father of Fractals**: The 20th century saw the birth of fractals as a formal field of study, largely thanks to Benoit B. Mandelbrot. In 1975, he coined the term 'fractal' to describe shapes that appear similar at any level of magnification. His work was inspired by earlier mathematicians but also by his study of real-world phenomena, like the irregularity of coastlines. Mandelbrot's book, "The Fractal Geometry of Nature," published in 1982, revolutionized how we understand many natural phenomena and patterns.

**Fractals in the Digital Age**: With the advent of computers, visualizing and generating fractals became much easier. They soon permeated various fields, from computer graphics in movies to the design of antennas and even in financial models. Computers allowed for deep dives into fractal sets, like the famous Mandelbrot set, revealing their endless intricacies.

Today, fractals continue to inspire scientists, artists, and thinkers alike. They bridge the gap between abstract mathematics and the tangible patterns we see in the world around us, standing as a testament to the beauty and complexity inherent in nature and mathematics.

## Characteristics of a Fractal

Till now, we took fractals as some shape that is somehow differnt from regular shapes like circles, squares, etc. So, if we are provided a shape, how do we see if it is fractal or not? Can we formalize what a fractal really is? It seems not.

**Attempts to Formally Define Fractals and Their Shortcomings**

1. **Self-similarity**: 
   - **Definition**: A fractal pattern appears the same (or statistically similar) regardless of the level of magnification.
   - **Shortcoming**: Not all fractals show exact self-similarity. 
   - **Example**: The coastline is often cited as a real-world fractal, due to its rough self-similarity. If you zoom in on a section of the coastline, it can appear jagged and irregular, much like the larger scale. However, the patterns aren't exactly identical at every scale, making them only *statistically* self-similar.

2. **Fractional Dimension**: 
   - **Definition**: Fractals often have non-integer (or fractional) dimensions.
   - **Shortcoming**: Not all objects with fractional dimensions have the visual or structural complexity associated with fractals.
   - **Example**: A sparse dusting of sand on a table might have a fractional dimension (because it's somewhere between a 2D plane and a 3D volume). However, this sand distribution doesn't exhibit the typical intricate patterns one would associate with fractals.

3. **Recursive Definition**: 
   - **Definition**: Fractals can be produced by repeating a simple process.
   - **Shortcoming**: Not all fractals are formed through recursion.
   - **Example**: The patterns seen in turbulent fluids or the distribution of galaxies in the universe can be fractal-like in nature. Yet, they aren't formed by a simple, repeated recursive process but rather by more complex interactions and dynamics.

4. **Complexity and Detail**: 
   - **Definition**: Fractals are shapes composed of parts similar to the whole, having details observable at every magnification level.
   - **Shortcoming**: Using complexity alone is too broad, and many complex patterns might not fit the traditional concept of a fractal.
   - **Example**: The branching of veins in a leaf may show intricate patterns with many details, but these patterns might not be self-similar or possess other fractal characteristics. They are complex but might not always be considered fractals based on other criteria.

I shamelessly take the below section from the Wikipedia to drive home the characteristics of a fractal,

> One point agreed on is that fractal patterns are characterized by fractal dimensions, but whereas these numbers quantify complexity (i.e., changing detail with changing scale), they neither uniquely describe nor specify details of how to construct particular fractal patterns. In 1975 when Mandelbrot coined the word "fractal", he did so to denote an object whose Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension is greater than its topological dimension. However, this requirement is not met by space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve.
>
>   Because of the trouble involved in finding one definition for fractals, some argue that fractals should not be strictly defined at all. According to Falconer, fractals should be only generally characterized by a gestalt of the following features;
>
> - **Self-similarity**, which may include:
    - *Exact self-similarity*: identical at all scales, such as the Koch snowflake
    - *Quasi self-similarity*: approximates the same pattern at different scales; may contain small copies of the entire fractal in distorted and degenerate forms; e.g., the Mandelbrot set's satellites are approximations of the entire set, but not exact copies.
    - *Statistical self-similarity*: repeats a pattern stochastically so numerical or statistical measures are preserved across scales; e.g., randomly generated fractals like the well-known example of the coastline of Britain for which one would not expect to find a segment scaled and repeated as neatly as the repeated unit that defines fractals like the Koch snowflake.
    - *Qualitative self-similarity*: as in a time series.
>
> - **Multifractal scaling**: characterized by more than one fractal dimension or scaling rule
Fine or detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. A consequence of this structure is fractals may have emergent properties (related to the next criterion in this list).
>
> - Irregularity locally and globally that cannot easily be described in the language of traditional Euclidean geometry other than as the limit of a recursively defined sequence of stages. For images of fractal patterns, this has been expressed by phrases such as "smoothly piling up surfaces" and "swirls upon swirls";see Common techniques for generating fractals.
As a group, these criteria form guidelines for excluding certain cases, such as those that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features. A straight line, for instance, is self-similar but not fractal because it lacks detail, and is easily described in Euclidean language without a need for recursion.

Even for mathematicians, who are very particular about formally defining concepts, fractals pose a significant challenge. I dont personally have any preferences for a particular definition of a fractal.
We don't have to do that for the purposes of this post.

## Inadequacy of conventional dimensions

As we've seen, the journey of fractals has been a rich tapestry of evolving definitions, each trying to encapsulate their mesmerizing complexity. Historically, scientists grappled with the challenge of defining these enigmatic figures, from their self-similarity to their resistance to traditional geometric classification. But why did these definitions matter? Why was it so crucial to understand what exactly a fractal is? The answer lies in the very nature of fractals themselves. By understanding their foundational properties, we can better appreciate their quirks, challenges, and the mysteries they present. And what better way to delve into this understanding than by exploring a practical example? 

We will consider the Sierpinski triangle to tease out the properties of fractals. By the end of this section, we should be sufficiently convinced that conventional integer dimensional spaces are inadequate to understand them.

### Constructing a Sierpinski Triangle

1. **Draw a Triangle**
   - Start by drawing an equilateral triangle on a piece of paper. This triangle will be the base for our pattern.
2. **Divide and Hollow Out**
   - Find the midpoint of each side of the triangle.
   - Connect these midpoints to form a smaller equilateral triangle in the center of the original triangle.
   - Now, "remove" or hollow out this smaller central triangle, leaving you with three smaller equilateral triangles at the corners.
3. **Repeat**
   - Treat each of the three smaller triangles as if they were the original triangle and repeat the process.
   - Find the midpoints of their sides, connect them, and hollow out the center triangle.
   - This will leave you with 9 even smaller triangles.
4. **Continue Recursively**
   - Keep repeating the process for each of the small triangles you get at every step. The more times you repeat, the more intricate and "fractal-like" the pattern becomes.
5. **Infinity**
   - In theory, this process continues infinitely. In practice, you'll stop when the triangles become too small to draw or discern.

What we're left with is a pattern that, no matter how closely you look at it, keeps revealing smaller triangles. self similarity! The Sierpinski triangle may look complicated, but its construction is based on a straightforward and repetitive process. It's a perfect example of how simple rules can lead to complex and beautiful patterns.

*The code for generating this triangle in javascript is in the source code of this webpage. Right-click -> view source -> Search for a function called `tripinski`*.

### Computing the perimeter and area

To understand why introducing a fractional dimension was even necessary for fractals, lets see how much our conventional notions of integer-dimensional spaces work with the Sierpinski triangle. What we mean by "conventional" is that our notion that lines are 1D objects, areas like triangle and rectangle are 2D objects, volumes like sphere and cube are 3D objects and so on. We will use this temporary notion of dimension for now, and formalize it later.

#### Perimeter

Computing the perimeter of an infinite object like the Sierpinski triangle is challenging. We can approach this problem is by first figuring our how the perimeter *changes* when you repeat the process of generating a fractal.
Once that is done, we can reason about how the perimeter behaves when approaching infinity.

We begin with a full equilateral triangle with area shaded in black. Assume each side has a length of $d$. The perimeter of this triangle is $3d$. Now, we can start our Sierpinski procedure. Let's create a new variable $P_0 = 3d$ to hold the perimeter at each iteration.

**Iteration 1**

Connect the midpoints of the big triangle and remove the resulting middle triangle. The figure we get looks like this
<canvas id="triangle_1" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 
Now the perimeter gets added because it has to account for the hole in the middle, 

$$P_1 = 3d + 3 \frac{d}{2}$$

The additional term adds the sides of the new triangle in the middle. This is good, it seems we are starting to find some pattern which is the side length always reduces to half.

**Iteration 2**

Connect the midpoints of all the possible sides and remove triangles again. The figure we get looks like this
<canvas id="triangle_2" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 

The perimeter now has to account for the new holes we created.

$$P_2 = 3d + (3 \frac{d}{2^1}) + 3 (3 \frac{d}{2^2})$$

Now, we are starting to see some pattern. It seems at each iteration, the number of triangles grow 3 times and the sidelength of the triangles halves. Let us do one of iteration and see if the pattern holds.

**Iteration 3**

Connect the midpoints of all the possible sides and remove triangles again. The figure we get looks like this
<canvas id="triangle_3" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 

The perimeter is

$$P_4 = 3d + (3 \frac{d}{2^1}) + 3 (3 \frac{d}{2^2}) + 3^2 (3 \frac{d}{2^3})$$

$$P_4 = 3d + 3^1 \frac{d}{2^1} + 3^2 \frac{d}{2^2} + 3^3 \frac{d}{2^3}$$

**Iteration n**

Now, it is fairly easy to see the pattern. At each iteration, a new term gets added to the area, which is some power of $\frac{3}{2}$ times the sidelength. 
We can generalize this, and write a form for the perimeter at the $n^{\text{th}}$ iteration.

$$P_n = 3d + \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^i d \,\,, n>0$$

The second term is a [geometric series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series) can be summed over (Check the linked Wikipedia page if a refresher is needed). We can now apply for the formula for the geometric series sum to reduce our perimeter.

$$P_n = 2d - d \left(\frac{1-\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{n+1}}{\frac{1}{2}}\right)$$

What happens to the perimeter when we approach infinity?

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} P_n = P_{\infty} = \infty$$

So perimeter reaches infinity. It makes sense because we are keeping on adding new triangles and hence new lines contributing to the perimeter.

In case, why $P_{\infty}$ is $\infty$ is not clear, we can take a step back. We had $2d-$*something* and the *something* is a very high negative number since we have $1-(\frac{3}{2})^{n+1}$ in the numerator and $\frac{3}{2} > 1$ which means it is going to infinity as we power the term.

#### Area

Now, lets see what happens to the area. First, lets recap that the area of an equilateral triangle and the entire black triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} d^2$ where $d$ is the side-length. We will call this $A_0$ so that we dont have to keep track of the annoying $\frac{3}{4}$ terms.

**Iteration 1**

<canvas id="areaTriangle_1" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 

In iteration 1, we are dividing the big triangle into $3$ small identical triangles. Therefore, the area has to be $A_0/4$ for each of the triangles. Then, we remove one of the triangles. The resultant area is

$$A_1 = A_0 - \frac{A_0}{4}$$

**Iteration 2**

<canvas id="areaTriangle_2" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 

In iteration 2, we repeat the same process of division for the 3 triangles obtained from the first iteration. Each small triangle will have the area $(A_0/4) \times 1/4 = A_0/4^2$. and we are removing $3$ of these small areas in this iteration.

$$A_2 = A_0 - \frac{A_0}{4} - 3 \frac{A_0}{4^2}$$

**Iteration 3**

<canvas id="areaTriangle_3" width="600" height="600" 
style="height:60%;width:60%;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;margin-bottom:10%;"></canvas> 

In iteration 3, we repeat the same process of division for the 9 triangles obtained from the second iteration. Each small triangle will have the area $(A_0/4^2) \times 1/4 = A_0/4^3$, and we are removing $3^2$ of these small areas in this iteration.

$$A_2 = A_0 - \frac{A_0}{4} - 3 \frac{A_0}{4^2} - 3^2 \frac{A_0}{4^3}$$

**Iteration n**

Now, we are in a good place to generalize to $n$ iterations. At each step of the iteration, I am adding a term that is $(3/4)$ times the previous factor. I am doing a bit of algebra (multiply and divide each term by 3) to write the summation in a neat form.

$$A_n = A_0 - \sum_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^i \frac{A_0}{3} \,\,\,, n>0$$

This is also a geometric series like before. Lets use the summation formula and reduce the summation in the term.

$$A_n = \frac{4}{3} A_0 - \left( \frac{1 - \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^{n+1}}{\frac{1}{4}} \frac{A_0}{3}\right)$$

Now, we can figure out what happens when $n$ approaches infinity by applying limits.

$$\lim_{n \to \infty} A_n = A_\infty = \frac{4}{3} A_0 - \frac{4}{3} A_0 = 0$$

The trick to get this is to see that $(\frac{3}{4})^n$ becomes smaller as the $n$ increases (as $\frac{3}{4} < 1$) with it converging to $0$ when approaching infinity.

#### Reflection

Now that we have the perimeter and area computed, we can compare the two. Recap:

$$P_\infty = \infty \text{ and } A_\infty = 0$$

Let's imagine now iterating through the triangle generation procedure. We take smaller and smaller triangles away from the larger triangle. So, in a way, the "edge" or perimeter of our triangle keeps growing. Now, if we were to paint the inside of this triangle at each iteration, you'd find that there's less and less space to paint each time. That's because the area inside the triangle keeps getting smaller.

It's enough to make you scratch your head: a shape with an edge that keeps growing but an inside that's disappearing! 

This weirdness is why mathematicians started to think that maybe the usual way we talk about dimensions doesn't quite work for something like the Sierpinski triangle. I mean, how can we have something that's bigger on the outside but smaller on the inside?

So, this trippy triangle tells us we might need some new math tools to understand these kinds of shapes better.
