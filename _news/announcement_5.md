New preprint released! We applied the Episodic Memory Theory to mechanistically intepret RNNs. We fully describe the behavior of RNNs trained on simple tasks and provide a method to interpret the learned parameters and hidden states. Check it out at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02430](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02430)
