      "summary": "The problem of inferring unobserved values in a partially observed trajectory from a stochastic process can be considered as a structured prediction problem which is traditionally conducted using heuristic-based Monte Carlo methods. In this project, I studied the application and effectiveness of learning proposals for sequential importance samplers using the concept of reinforced variational inference. Work done was published in ICLR 2019, Deep Reinforcement Learning Meets Structured Prediction workshop. The final product is an open source framework that provides a convenient interface for researchers to create and manage Reinforced Variational Inference experiments.",
